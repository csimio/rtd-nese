Welcome to NESE documentation!
===================================

The Northeast Storage Exchange (NESE) is a collaborative project of the MGHPCC and its founding
partners to deploy a regional resource that addresses the escalating need for short, medium, and
long-term storage of research data.

Funding for creation of NESE was provided by the NSF Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBs)
program to encourage development of robust and shared data-centric cyberinfrastructure capabilities,
and to accelerate interdisciplinary and collaborative research in areas of inquiry stimulated by data.

NESE Objectives:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create a long-term, growing, self-sustaining storage facility serving both regional researchers and national and international-scale science and engineering projects.

* Develop data-centric infrastructure aimed at accelerating interdisciplinary and collaborative research for science, engineering, education and economic development.

* Provide easy access to shared assets through co-development with related projects such as `NERC <https://nerc.mghpcc.org>`_, `the MOC Alliance <https://www.bu.edu/hic/centers-initiatives-labs/mocalliance/>`_, and `the Open Storage Network <https://www.openstoragenetwork.org>`_.


Target Audience:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* PIs looking for more information on storage services should see `NESE Services <https://nesedev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/services.html>`_

* Researchers looking for more information on how to use the storage sercices should see `Using NESE <https://nesedev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-nese.html>`_

* Sysadmins who are running NESE sites should see the `Technical Documentation <https://nesedev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical-docs.html>`_ for more information

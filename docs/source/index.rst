Welcome to NESE documentation!
===================================

The Northeast Storage Exchange (NESE) is a collaborative project of the MGHPCC and its founding
partners to deploy a regional resource that addresses the escalating need for short, medium, and
long-term storage of research data.

Funding for creation of NESE was provided by the NSF Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBs)
program to encourage development of robust and shared data-centric cyberinfrastructure capabilities,
to accelerate interdisciplinary and collaborative research in areas of inquiry stimulated by data.

NESE Objectives:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create a long-term, growing, self-sustaining storage facility serving both regional researchers and national and international-scale science and engineering projects.

* Develop data-centric infrastructure aimed at accelerating interdisciplinary and collaborative research for science, engineering, education and economic development.

* Provide easy access to shared assets through co-development with related projects such as `NERC <https://nerc.mghpcc.org>`_, `the MOC Alliance <https://www.bu.edu/hic/centers-initiatives-labs/mocalliance/>`_, and `the Open Storage Network <https://www.openstoragenetwork.org>`_.
